            <p>Culture; that's the lazy answer people give when their motivation to travel the world is questioned. I'd have to claim it as my reason too because I want to challenge my perspective and live like the local where ever I go. I never travelled overseas before, so I satieated this desire by reading up Wikipedia, random forums and The Vice Guide to Travel. I still do.</p>
            <p>But why China? It's got a beutiful landscape and rich cultural heritage. I first found out about China as a kid through Kung Fu Panda and marvled at it's beauty.</p>

            <p>I really like their electronic music. Boiler Room on YouTube has lots of great sets done by Chinese artists in their cities.</p> <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2cA6GvgvffqqXZmTMQI763?utm_source=generator" width="50%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

                 <p>However, some things can't go unsaid. The greatest victims of the Chinese Communist Party are the people it claims dominion over. Its travesties against society, the environment, and the economy can't be ignored. However, the actions of the CCP don't define Chinese Culture, nor can they eliminate my love for the nation's people and my appreciation for the utilities and vanities that they enjoy. Regardless of opinion, God is good, and He establishes their authority. (Romans 13)</p> 
                 <p>Curiosity in culture is the main reason, but I'm also interested in thrills, tech and food. Additionally, it's quite cheap.</p>
                 <p>Frugality and liberty are my desired qualities for an adventure, so I decided to go backpacking. I know I couldn't have as much fun by myself, so I invited a couple of likeminded mates in August 2022. A maximum amount of co-travellrers would be ideally three, mainly because a taxi driver can take up to four fellas. The constraints of money, time and energy are real so I wanted to propose an idea, establish shared goals and collectively shape the plan to acheive our goals. The Model for managing complex change chart adapted from Knoster, T. (1991) best encapsulates the framework.</p>

                 <div class="body-text"><p>In the end, Daniel DeHaan was both able and willing to send it. We both had similar interests and were in the same situation: just finishing high school, about to start Studying Engineering and were wanting to pay for the trip ourselves. This whole trip was quite risky because for most of the time between inception and fruition, it simply was not possibble without an incredibly researched plan.</p></div>
