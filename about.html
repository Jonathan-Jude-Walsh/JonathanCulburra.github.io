    <p><em>Matthew 16:24-26</em><div><p>Then Jesus told his disciples,<em>â€œIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and <b>follow me.</b> For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?</p></div></em></p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <h5>Hello!</h5>
        <p>My identity is Christian, my country is Australia and my passion is Mechatronic Engineering.</p>
        <p>I grew up in the coastal town of Culburra, where my close-knit family and local community, surrounded by natural beauty, has played a significant role in shaping my outlook on life. My journey has been deeply influenced by my love for Jesus Christ, which secures my eternity and guides my personal growth and decision-making process.</p>
        <p>As I pursued my academic journey at the University of Wollongong, I grew in my passion for Mechatronic Engineering. This field perfectly aligns with my love for problem-solving and my interest in the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software systems. My time at university has not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how technology can be harnessed to solve real-world problems.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to bring glory to God by contributing to innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
