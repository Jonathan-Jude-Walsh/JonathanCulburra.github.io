    <p><em>Matthew 16:24-26</em><div><p>Then Jesus told his disciples,<em>â€œIf anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and <b>follow me.</b> For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?</p></div></em></p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <h5>Hello!</h5>
        <p>I grew up in the coastal town of Culburra, NSW, where my close-knit family and local community, surrounded by natural beauty, have greatly influenced my outlook on life. My faith in Jesus Christ has been a cornerstone of my journey, providing me with eternal hope and guiding my personal growth and decision-making.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Wollongong. I am deeply passionate about applying Mechatronic Engineering to the field of National Security, where my love for problem-solving converges with my interest in integrating mechanical, electrical, and software systems. My academic experiences are not only honing my technical skills but also enhancing my understanding of how technology can address security challenges across civilian, governmental, and private sectors.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to glorify God by working collaboratively to create innovative, adaptive, and agile security solutions.</p>
