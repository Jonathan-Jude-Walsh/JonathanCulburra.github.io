        <div class="body-text">
            <p>Culture; that's the lazy answer people give when their motivation to travel the world is questioned. I'd have to claim it as my reason too because I want to challenge my perspective and live like the local where ever I go. I never travelled overseas before, so I satieated this desire by reading up Wikipedia, random forums and The Vice Guide to Travel. I still do.</p>
            <p>But why China? It's got a beutiful landscape and rich cultural heritage. I first found out about China as a kid through Kung Fu Panda and marvled at it's beauty.</p>

            <p>I really like their electronic music. Boiler Room on YouTube has lots of great sets done by Chinese artists in their cities.</p> <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2cA6GvgvffqqXZmTMQI763?utm_source=generator" width="50%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

                 <p>Curiosity in culture is the main reason, but I'm also interested in thrills, tech and food. Additionally, it's quite cheap.</p>
                 <p>Frugality and liberty are my desired qualities for an adventure, so I decided to go backpacking. I know I couldn't have as much fun by myself, so I invited a couple of likeminded mates in August 2022. A maximum amount of co-travellrers would be ideally three, mainly because a taxi driver can take up to four fellas. The constraints of money, time and energy are real so I wanted to propose an idea, establish shared goals and collectively shape the plan to acheive our goals. The Model for managing complex change chart adapted from Knoster, T. (1991) best encapsulates the framework.</p>

                 <div class="body-text"><p>In the end, Daniel DeHaan was both able and willing to send it. We both have similar interests and were in the same situation: just finishing high school, about to start Studying Engineering and were wanting to pay for the trip ourselves. This whole trip was quite risky because for most of the time between inception and fruition, it simply was not possibble without an incredibly researched plan.</p></div>
            
        <h5 id="section2">The Plan</h5>
        <div class="body-text">
        <p>CoViD-19 restrictions made it impossible to travel in China until March 15, 2023 when the PRC resumed issuing tourism Visas. Plans were still being made before then and after. But with so much uncertainty, where do you begin? Here's a list of questions you must answer.</p>
        <p>1. How much time you have to travel? Our time constraints were the mid-year Uni holidays, which gave us 3 weeks.</p>
        <p>2. How much time are you willing to travel each day? This will determine how far you are willing to travel. Night trains allowed Dan and I to spend most of the day at the destination and spend the time travelling whilst we sleep.</p>
        <p>3. What do you you want to do? Go to Google Maps and create your own map with a collection of these destinations. We we're optimistic and added every place that interested us and then culled them down later. This determined how long we stayed in a city.</p>
        <p>4. What route will you take? Use the information from the previous questions to create a route that threads through the most desired desitinations. Alternatively, you can just visit the following address and be guided by the great templates. They've got plenty more info.</p>

        <p>5. What transport can you use? Use Baidu to find the most accurate route. Google maps is useless in China. If you don't know Chinese, get Google Lense which can translate pictures quickly.</p>
        <p>ㅤㅤa. Inter-city transport is usually done by trains. Through travelling by night trains, you can save lots of money and time. Be very observant in noticing how often a train goes on the one route. You won't be able to see the timetable months ahead, so find your desired train and figure out the earliest date you have to buy the ticket for it. Be very careful with the T&Cs.</p>

       <div><a href="https://trains.ctrip.com/">ㅤㅤ Click here for trains.Ctrip.com (Chinese)</a></div>
       <p>ㅤㅤb. Within the city. The metro system within the city is cheap and usually spans across all areas you want to go. Baidu Maps has the most reliable information in the one place on metro, buses and taxis. Dan and I mainly just walked and rode the Alipay Hello Bikes wherever trains couldn't take us.</p>
       <div><a href="https://maps.baidu.com/">ㅤㅤ Baidu Maps (Chinese)</a></div>
       <p>ㅤㅤc. Between Countries. Find the cheapest flights. It's pretty simple.</p>
       <div><a href="https://www.google.com/travel/flights">ㅤㅤ Google Flights (English)</a></div>
       <p>6. What accommodation will you use? Dan and I used Meitwan which came with lots of issues (most hotels don't accept foreigners and many didn't exist when we went to the address). Instead, I would recommend you use trustworthy sites such as Trip Advisor to find cheap hotels when you can't travel by night train.</p>
