    <h2>Career</h2>
    <h5>Applying skills and knowledge</h5>
    <p>This represents the application of my ambitions and education, but it is not the entirety of <a href="about.html">who I am</a>.</p>
    <div><p><em>James 4:14-17</em>
        <p> Now listen, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.”<em>Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. <b>What is your life?</b>  You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. </em>Instead, you ought to say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”. As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil. If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.</p></div></p>

    <h5>General Endeavors</h5>
    <p>My personal and professional development has been shaped by diverse experiences, including technical roles in engineering projects, undergraduate tutoring, and leadership within community organisations. These varied engagements have cultivated skills in problem-solving, teamwork, and communication, equipping me to adapt and contribute in dynamic environments. While I value specialisation, I believe my broad skill set enriches my ability to innovate and adapt to solve complex challenges.</p>

    <p>For a detailed overview of my career and achievements, you can explore my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-walsh-5b4985200/">LinkedIn</a> profile. My interests extend beyond engineering; I am committed to continual learning and personal growth in volunteering for the Church Soup Kitchen, Church Music Band for cello and vocals, as Patrol Captain at Nowra Culburra Surf Life Saving Club, and learning Mandarin.</p>
    <h5>Mechatronic Engineering</h5>
    <p>The pursuit of designing, constructing, and optimising technology to achieve meaningful outcomes deeply inspires me. I am particularly captivated by the integration and refinement of mechanical, electrical, and computational systems to create sophisticated, efficient solutions. Studying for a <a href="academia.html">Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering</a> aligns perfectly with my aspirations, offering a comprehensive foundation to tackle real-world challenges and innovate at the intersection of diverse technologies.</p>
    <p>My goal is to apply my degree in the field of National Security. I am particularly interested in Military Technology, Geo-Spatial Intelligence, and General Instrumentation. To ensure confidentiality, I prioritise discretion by omitting or generalising sensitive details in any public discussions. I respect security protocols and am fully committed to maintaining professional confidentiality.</p>
